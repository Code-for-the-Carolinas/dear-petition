### Elements

Elements are atomic, reusable UI components. Think \<Input\> or \<Button\>.

Elements DO return display-level JSX. They cannot return containers or pages. They DO sometimes return other elements.

HINT: Build these like you're building them for a component library-- 100% modular and project agnostic
